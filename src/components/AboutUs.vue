    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>WELCOME TO THE USOMI STEM SCHOOL LIBRARY</h2>
    At our school, we believe that a library is more than just a collection of booksâ€”it's a hub for learning, exploration, and community.
     Our library is designed to be a vibrant, welcoming space where students, teachers, and staff can access a wealth of resources, cultivate a love for reading, and engage in lifelong learning.
    
    <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
    Our mission is to support the academic, intellectual, and personal growth of our students by providing access to a diverse range of resources, fostering a love for reading, and promoting information literacy.
     We strive to create an inclusive environment that encourages curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking.

     <h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
     The origins of our school library trace back to the early 2000s, when our institution recognized the growing importance of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education.
      To support our ambitious academic programs, we established a dedicated library that would serve as a cornerstone for STEM learning, research, and innovation.
      Our library was officially founded in 2003, thanks to the combined efforts of our visionary school leaders, generous donors, and passionate educators. 
      The initial collection focused on essential STEM subjects, featuring foundational texts in mathematics, cutting-edge research in science, and pioneering works in engineering and technology.
